# Qtrip MADQN

The presented Qtrip algorithm stands as a testament to the power and versatility of reinforcement learning techniques. Designed as a travel optimization tool, its foundational philosophy lies in tailoring travel recommendations to individual user preferences, hence revolutionizing the traditional approach to itinerary planning.

Deep Q-Networks (DQN) have been instrumental in allowing the application of Q-learning to complex tasks with large state and action spaces by approximating the Q-value function with neural networks. When extending to the multi-agent domain, the scenario gets intricate due to the concurrent actions and strategies of multiple agents
