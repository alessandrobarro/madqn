# Qtrip MADQN - Abstract

Deep Q-Networks (DQN) have revolutionized the reinforcement learning landscape by using neural networks to approximate Q-value functions, addressing tasks with large state and action spaces. One of the most challenging computational optimization problems in computer science, especially in the realm of travel, is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This study introduces the Qtrip algorithm, which leverages DQNs to optimize travel itineraries. Unlike traditional methods, Qtrip can accommodate an infinite range of user- specific preferences, offering highly personalized travel routes. By integrating a multi-agent system, we tap into the collective intelligence of Multi-Agent Deep Q-Networks (MADQNs). Aggregating insights from multiple agents during training, the Qtrip algorithm improves robustness and accuracy in itinerary optimization. Our initial results highlight the potential of MADQNs not just for reimagining TSP formulations but also for innovating adaptive, user-focused travel optimization techniques in modern computing.
